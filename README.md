# OWASP-WSTG-v4.2-practice
This repository documents structured, hands-on practice of the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) v4.2.
It serves as a technical record of manual web application security testing performed in alignment with OWASP's official testing methodology. 


The repository contains detailed test case write-ups, step-by-step validation procedures, captured evidence (requests, responses, payloads), and concise technical conclusions for each WSTG test case practiced.
Each test case is mapped directly to its corresponding WSTG category. 


Every documented test case includes a clear objective, defined test environment, practical execution steps, evidence of testing, and a binary security outcome (vulnerable or not vulnerable), reflecting real-world penetration testing and audit standards.


This repository is maintained as a professional security assessment log, suitable for technical reviews, and applied learning validation.
