## Category

Information Gathering

## Objective

The objective of this test case is to identify the web application framwork, platform in use. This includes detecting framework-specific headers, default files, directory structures, and responses that reveal the underlying technology.

The goal is to understand the technology stack so later tests can target framework-specific vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and known weaknesses.
